Reagan loves his new Early Childhood School!  Our only issue so far has been morning car ramp.  They are about to have to do some staff training (at my request, actually) because they have some staff members who, in the past, worked with typical kids and don't seem to get that a child in a SLC classroom doesn't always follow verbal directions or make eye contact ESPECIALLY if the staff member is unfamiliar.  We have had to modify Reagan's drop off procedure for a few weeks to avoid complete meltdowns that included laying on the concrete and refusing to move.  (and staff members telling him to look at them and listen to their instructions.)  That has been the ONLY issue, though!  He does love it there and is always excited to see the building.  He loves his teacher and one of the aides.  The other one they are still working on him responding to her at all.  His class will be full next week with the addition of one more boy.  That will be 5 children with 3 adults!  Yippee!!!!

We have already had strep also.  They called me to pick him up from school because he was happy, but wouldn't eat or drink.  NO fever at all!  Of course, then his teacher got it too!  Oops!  Still doing breathing treatments off and on.  Our new pediatrician wants us to do allergy testing eventually.  The test for the genetic syndrome came back negative, and we have done all of the ones there are to do for now except for a few that won't make a difference as there are no treatments.  We'll wait to do those in a year or two when newer ones come out if any of them would change the course of anything.  Our new geneticist says that she also feels that his problems are genetic in nature.

They started the school year from scratch as Reagan would not do things for them that he did with his therapists in Louisiana.  New people, new location, so no go on lots of skills at first.  Within a week and a half, he was used to them enough that he showed them what he could do.  He has mastered wearing his backpack (a major ordeal at first for someone who hates straps on his shoulders!), using the sign for music with a verbal or visual prompt, responding to a partial physical and sometimes verbal prompt for pulling food away from his mouth rather than overstuffing, and filling in the word BED in the 5 Little Monkeys Song.  Okay, he only makes a noise, but we are calling it the word BED even if it sounds nothing like it.  I guess there is a method to the madness.

He is stimming much more now that he is in school.  There is a lot of blinking added to our usual routine of circling, opening and closing, lining up plastic alphabet letters and numbers, etc.  I would still say that it doesn't interfere so much, but it does make him look less typical when we are out.  There are more tantrums during transitions than before, but I think he is just getting used to our new schedule.

There are more autism meetings than I can possibly attend in any given time.  I have tried out several groups and found one or two that I like more than the others.  One is a school sponsored group of only parents of younger spectrum kids.  It is run by the in-home training ladies.  Through that group I have met the other moms from Reagan's class.  Now I know that 2 of the 3 other boys are quite verbal compared to Reagan.  They each have 150+ functional words.  The class is ABA based, but not strict ABA.  On Fridays, they use what they have worked on during the week in different settings around the school trying to make it stick in different locations and situations.  We are very pleased so far!

Here is a link that was in the Dallas Morning News this past week about Reagan's school:

Apparently we're not the only ones to move here and take advantage of all Frisco has to offer!
