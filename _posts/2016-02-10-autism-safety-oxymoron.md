This weekend was a conundrum of major safety issues.  Friday evening we went to eat with friends who also had children.  The noise inside seemed to really bother Reagan, so we sat on their large covered / mostly enclosed porch area.  When we got ready to leave,  I took him out of his highchair and reached to grab the bag of fidget toys.  Something spooked him, and he took off running and screaming, almost making it to the parking lot.  Choosing the lesser of two evils, I tripped my 3 year old child.  Trust me when I say this was not a proud moment.  It really scared me horribly, as you can imagine.  There was no warning at all.  

As if that were not bad enough, Saturday we were out running errands when I had to return to my car for a moment.  After my experience the day before, I took no chances.  I put Reagan in the passenger seat while I placed one item in the car and took another one out.  That way I could use my whole body to block him in.  He crawled across to the drivers' side seat and started to open the door.  I quickly hit the lock, closed my door and ran around to grab him after trying to pull him across the car and fearing I would hurt him as he resisted.  I did all of this in a split second and got to the other side, he had closed that door too.  

My keys were inside the car.  Yes, I'm serious.  

**Dead **serious.  

Luckily I had my phone and immediately called 911\.  I knew I would not be able to get Reagan to unlock the door or follow directions.  Typical 3 year olds don't follow those rules, so there is NO WAY a 3 year old with autism is going to!

In true Frisco style, everyone but the FBI in helicopters showed up.....sirens, lights, fire department., paramedics.....the whole 9 yards.  I was parked in the shade, and we had only been inside for about 15 minutes, so the car was not scalding ho despite the 105 degree temperatures.  Reagan was having a grand time climbing all over the car where he found his beloved DVD cases that we had hidden in the back of the car thinking he would never look for them there.  (Note to self:  Must find a new hiding place now!)  He was smiling, laughing and babbling at his beloved cases while they tried unsuccessfully to break into the car, and I tried unsuccessfully to get him to not be autistic and push the unlock button.  

He also climbed to the back to watch the strobing lights on the firetruck, but was oblivious to the men surrounding our car trying to break in.  They finally said that they were concerned that he may not react in a typical fashion to being too hot, so even though he seemed in no way distressed (I was....Chance was.....Reagan - having a party in the van!) they thought they should break the window.  They did, and Reagan thought it was the BEST thing ever.  He squealed at the cascading glass and laughed hysterically.  Chance cried and asked repeatedly if I was going to jail.  (REALLY???  As if I didn't feel bad enough!)  Then he collected a small cup of the broken glass for his memory box.  Oh the joys of the gifted child with the anxiety and the perfectionism and the desire to make a great paragraph out of  all experiences.  I'm sure his future teacher will think highly of me after she reads this in his journal.  Insert loud sigh here.

I was very impressed with the way the firemen addressed the autism issue.  Then I realized that the one who called the shots and seemed to know the most about autism was married to a teacher at Reagan's special needs preschool.  

Public. Parent. Fail.

Go ahead and nominate me for worst special needs parent of the year (I think I'll nominate myself!)  While he makes progress in all areas, my kid, is sowing some serious wild oats.  Be warned!  

I have spent a ton of time since the kids have gone to bed researching safety ideas.  I think I'll compile them and share them next month when I assist with the safety lecture to parents in our district.  Yes.  They chose ME to talk.  Maybe they had the foresight to know that I would have even MORE experience with Houdini and might even need community service hours for parole.  

Just kidding.  They didn't arrest me.  Apparently kids with autism outsmart parents without autism regularly.  It's to be expected.

I have a lot to learn, but I love my little teacher with all my heart.
