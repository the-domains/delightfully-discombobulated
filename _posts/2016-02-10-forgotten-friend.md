I talked you through your darkest hours. 

Held your hand. 

Cried your tears too. 

I'm glad things have turned the corner. 

Apparently I'm still on the other side. 

Waiting. 

Wondering. 

Worrying. 

It's dark here. 

I can see myself with the fears, worries and burdens I carry for you. 

But I can't see you. 

I don't even know there is light around the corner. 

You should have told me. 

Feeling alone. 

Forgotten when the world was my oyster. 

Now living in solitude in your empty shell. 

Left behind for the sunshine you found. 

But I lost mine in the process. 

You celebrate with careless abandon.

I mourn my loss.

Oblivious perspective.
