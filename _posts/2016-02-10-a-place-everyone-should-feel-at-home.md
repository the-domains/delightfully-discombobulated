A lady, who is now the children's minister at a church we attended before moving to Texas, called me the other day, leaving a message on my cell phone.  Her message was asking which service we would be attending in the fall when Reagan started kindergarten so that they could put him in the correct class.  I probably should have ignored it.  I would have in the past.....but I just couldn't this time.

So I called her back.  I explained that we had not attended that church since Reagan was 20 months old. After he was moved out of the baby class into the toddler class (skipping the walker class that other kids had gone to in the interim) I was told that there "was not a place for him" after being paged to come get him several Sundays in a row because he didn't / couldn't / wouldn't do what the other kids did. While I realized that this was not her doing nor was it her fault, I still felt the need to tell her again how much that act had been the most hurtful so far with my child.  It hurt more than the diagnosis of autism.  It hurt more than the stares.  It hurt more than the condescending tone people sometimes take when your child is different.  It hurt because everyone should have a place in church.  Despite my feelings about religion being quite different than spirituality and my dislike of trying to fit into a religious "box" that is defined by denominational rules, all churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples should have room for all who care to participate.

As one of the largest churches in town, they needed to understand that special needs children are everywhere.  They have siblings and moms and dads and grandparents.  Excluding my child meant excluding the rest of us as well.  Ironic (or perhaps hypocritical, if I may) that this church loved to brag about its size and budget.  Wow.

I also told her that it was the single most painful thing that had happened to me since he had been diagnosed.  I told her the whole, ugly story while I sobbed on the phone as if it happened yesterday.  Then she asked, "Did he attend our Mothers' Day Out or preschool program?"  Ouch.....  As if I hadn't felt like I was dumping a burden on her that wasn't hers to deal with in the first place, she had to open a whole new can of worms!

I told her how they wouldn't even consider him after I told them of his diagnosis - autism.  Another church's Mother's Day Out program director told me that she would take him with open and loving arms, but this larger church had bought that church to use as a satellite location where a sermon was shown on a big screen 2 miles down the road.  A town of 12,000 doesn't need a 2nd location for a church that isn't filled to the brim on a Sunday morning. The larger church took over the preschool program as well, shutting it down before we could even start.  (Side note that the 2nd church was prime real estate and the property was sold after the satellite idea faded.)   

I also told her about my friend who DID take her son to the church for their preschool program as he was more verbal and didn't, at the time, have a full-fledged autism diagnosis.  I told her that this friend was left out of things - the music program where the kids sang songs and recited poems for an audience of parents, the Mother's Day Tea, the Dad's Birdhouse Building Day, and how angry it made me all over again to see it happening to someone else.

The lady on the phone, whom I really felt horrible for, suggested that there were other churches in the area that would accommodate a child like mine.  I told her that we had eventually found one at a much smaller church with a much smaller budget that had even less classroom size and personnel.  because it was important for me to not let the world give up on my kid and also important that my older son still be able to attend programs he loved so much.   They loved Reagan from the time he walked in the door, saw his potential, and never once would have suggested that he had no place there PERIOD.  She said that they had "tried" to reopen a special needs class this past fall.  They had bought many "manipulatives" and tried to get the word out, but no one showed up.  I told her that, perhaps, they had already heard about others' experiences.  Plus, I pointed out that no special manipulatives are needed to start the class....just willing hearts and unconditional love.  Surely a church has that?

Finally, I decided that she had probably written me off as a crazed woman, so let the conversation wind down.  I told her that, despite my not living there anymore, moms like me are everywhere.  We are the very people who need a community to belong to as we often feel like we don't fit in other places.  I told her that there were people at the church who had loved my child, but if the church itself could not accept him and make room for him, then - I now realize that in hindsight - they are the ones who missed out.  I'm not sure I convinced her, but if I caused one person to lose a little sleep that night, thinking about the people they have turned away, then I feel quite accomplished.  I'm not holding my breath, though Did they ever stop to think "What would Jesus do?"  Ooooh  oooohhh  Pick me!!!!  Pick me!!!!  I've got the answer to this one!!!!

So  I'm a crazed mom who may be locked up in the asylum by the men in white coats next time I visit the area.  It was actually a nice little emotional cleansing for me.  Someone should probably forward her counseling bills to me.  I deserve them.
