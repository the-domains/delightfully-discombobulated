Okay...I'll admit it.  I'm the Queen of the Clorox wipe.  So I laughed at my neighbor when she started talking about the non-toxic cleaners that she had been guilted into trying by another friend who is turning slightly crunchy.  (Don't get me wrong...I'm all for saving the Earth, but cloth diapers are not in my vocabulary.) 

So she convinced me to try Mrs. Meyers Clean Day telling me how great it smelled.  (I DO love a good smelling cleaner!)  WOW!!!  I stare at my expensive bottle now that I purchased after driving 30 miles to the nearest Whole Foods DYING for cleaning day to come so that I can mix it up and make my house smell HEAVENLY. Forget Pine-Sol!  This stuff ROCKS my SOCKS!  Aromatherapy for the most reluctant housewife, I tell you!

I've been cleaning all day awaiting the return of my beloved husband.  He has been gone for 6 weeks, and I miss him more than words can say.    I fully respect single moms, military wives, and anyone else who raises 2 kids on their own.   I never realized how much help he was until he was gone for 6 weeks straight!!!

But back to Mrs. Meyers.....Ah yes....lemon verbena scent.  I can smell it from the other room.  It smells cleaner than anything I've ever smelled in my life.

Housework is calling!  Hasta luego!
