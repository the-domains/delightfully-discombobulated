**I attended the vendor area of the Autism Conference that was held in Dallas this week as I could only go for part of one day with Patrick's work schedule.  It was a bit disappointing not to be able to attend sessions, but I was at least able to learn more about services offered for children like Reagan.  
The kicker is that the day after attending, I received a phone call asking if I was still at the conference.  I explained that I was not because I lived in the Dallas area.  They asked if I could come back to the conference and pick up an item I won in a drawing - an iPad!!!   I said that I probably would be able to do that despite having said many times that an iPad is nothing but a glorified iPhone that's bigger and doesn't make phone calls.  Let's just say, I stand corrected!  This thing ROCKS!  It's now loaded up with awesome apps for Reagan that are completely geared toward children with autism!  They even made sure they were at his functioning level!    
While I did the PR interview and photos, Chance was snagged by the group next to us.  It was the people from Google!  (Not just anyone....it was the big guns!)   They had chosen to launch a new product called SketchUp, kind of like "ketchup" with an S added to the beginning.  They had Chance play with it while they talked the audience gathered around about the program and how user-friendly it is.  (I guess the point was that it was so user friendly even a 2nd grader could do it?  Someone should inform them that I have a crazy smart 2nd grader!)  It seemed like a pretty big deal, and I wish I had been able to get pictures or a video of him doing the demonstration with them.  I think it's pretty awesome of Google to launch something at an autism conference.  That's a pretty nice vote of confidence for our kids!  
Here is the newsletter from the company who gave us the iPad. It's called WellSpring, and they provide in-home ABA services in California and now Florida.  They hope to launch in Texas at some point.  I told them to let me know because Frisco is the place they need to have their Texas headquarters, right?**
